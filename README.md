  ## Description
    This project is about building a text editor that runs in the browser.
    The app is a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. Additionally, it will feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline.

    The text editor is started with an existing application and implement methods for getting and storing data to an IndexedDB database. It used a package called `idb`, which is a lightweight wrapper around the IndexedDB API. It features a number of methods that are useful for storing and retrieving data, and is used by companies like Google and Mozilla.
